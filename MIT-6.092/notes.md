## Lecture 1: Types, Variables, Operators

* Programming languages like Java help us humans instruct the CPU.
* Steps to run a Java program: Source Code (.java) -> javac -> Byte Code (.class) -> java
* A Java program can be compiled and run from a single class structure.
* Variable values in Java can be assigned when initialized.
* When assignment of a variable occurs, the value is use rather than the pointer, unless specified.
