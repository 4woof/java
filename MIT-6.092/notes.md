# MIT 6.092 Lecture Notes

### Lecture 1: Types, Variables, Operators

* Programming languages like Java help us humans instruct the CPU.
* Steps to run a Java program: Source Code (.java) -> javac -> Byte Code (.class) -> java
* A Java program can be compiled and run from a single class structure.
* Variable values in Java can be assigned when initialized.
* When assignment of a variable occurs, the value is use rather than the pointer, unless specified.

### Lecture 2: More types, Methods, Conditionals

* Types are defined as kinds of values that can be stored and manipulated.
* A Variable is defined as the named location that stores a value.
* Instructed on the use of += operations to store the incremented value to itself.
* Division operates differently on integers and doubles.
* Mismatched types occur when initializing a variable to a value of the wrong data type.
* Casting converts one type to another if allowed.
* Methods have a return type and contain arguments.
* Methods are called by referencing the name of the method along with specifying any arguments necessary.
* Parameters are given to methods in the form of an expression.
* Return values pass out of the method an expression of the specified type given in the method's header.
* Method parameters are like defining a new variable in the method.
* Abstraction is the sense that a user does not need to know how a method works, only how to use it.
* Conversion by method: `Integer.toString()` and `Integer.parseInt()`
